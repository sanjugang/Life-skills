### Question 1. Which point(s) were new to me?

- **Over-Communicate Scenario**:
    - It was helpful to learn the importance of letting the team know about issues like internet or laptop problems. I often don’t share these things, but it’s good to keep the team updated.
    - I liked the idea of using group chats instead of private messages. This way, everyone can see the issue and maybe help out.

- **Question Clarity**:
    - I didn’t realize how important it is to explain problems clearly when asking for help. Adding screenshots or using tools like Loom or GitHub Gists can make a big difference.
    - The example of open-source projects showed me how important it is to be clear when asking for help, especially in big teams.

- **Involvement Principles**:
    - The idea of "work when you work, play when you play" really stuck with me. It’s a good reminder to have separate time for work and personal activities.
    - I hadn’t thought about using tools like Boosted to block distractions. I can definitely try that to help me focus better.



### Question 2. Which area do I think, I need to improve on? What are my ideas to make progress in that area?

- **Improving Communication**:
    - I need to get better at keeping the team updated on what I’m working on or if I’m facing any challenges.
    - I plan to use the team channels for updates instead of sending direct messages. This way, everyone will know what’s going on.
    - I’ll try to keep my video on during meetings to help build a stronger connection with my teammates.

- **Focused Work (Deep Work)**:
    - I plan to use tools like **Freedom** to block websites that distract me and help me focus.
    - I’ll turn off notifications for things that aren’t urgent so I can stay focused on my work.
    - I want to create a clear work schedule that includes time for breaks, exercise, and meals.

- **Getting To Know My Teammates**:
    - I’ll try to join meetings a few minutes early to chat with my team and get to know them better.
    - I want to set up quick one-on-one calls to learn more about my teammates’ schedules and work styles.
