### What can you do?

If you experience or see sexual harassment, here’s what you can do:

1. **Speak up**: Tell the person to stop in a polite but firm way.  
2. **Write it down**: Keep track of what happened, including dates, details, and anyone who saw it.  
3. **Report it**: Talk to someone you trust, like HR, a manager, or a specific committee at your workplace.  
4. **Get support**: Share how you feel with friends, family, or even a counselor who can help you deal with the situation.

_It’s important to speak up because it can help stop the behavior and keep others safe too._
