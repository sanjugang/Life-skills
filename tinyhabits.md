# Tiny Habits

### Question 1: What was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The idea I liked the most was how tiny habits, when linked to something we already do, can make a big difference in our lives. For example, the story about starting a flossing habit by flossing just one tooth really stuck with me. It shows that starting small and keeping it simple is the best way to form new habits.

### Question 2: How can we use B = MAP to make forming new habits easier? What do M, A, and P stand for?

B = MAP means Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt. It’s a simple formula for building habits:

- **Motivation (M):** Do something that feels meaningful or rewarding.
- **Ability (A):** Make the habit super easy, so it doesn’t take much effort.
- **Prompt (P):** Use reminders to trigger the habit.

For example, if you want to drink more water, keep a water bottle on your desk (prompt), start with small sips (ability), and think about how it benefits your health (motivation).

### Question 3: Why is it important to celebrate after doing a habit?

Celebrating makes you feel good about the habit. When you celebrate, your brain connects the habit with happiness, which makes you want to do it again. That positive feeling helps the habit stick.

### Question 4: What was the most interesting idea for you in the video?

The idea that "emotions create habits, not repetition" really stood out. Instead of relying on willpower, connecting a habit to good emotions—like smiling or celebrating—makes it easier and more enjoyable to keep doing it.

### Question 5: What does the book say about identity?

The book says habits aren’t just about what we do—they’re about who we want to be. For example, instead of saying, "I want to exercise," you can say, "I’m the kind of person who exercises." Thinking this way makes habits feel more meaningful and natural.

### Question 6: How can we make a habit easier to do?

To make a habit easier:

- Break it into super small steps.
- Remove anything that makes it harder.
- Match the habit to your current energy or skill level.
- Tie it to something you already do, like brushing your teeth or making coffee.

For example, if you want to start exercising, just start with one push-up. Over time, you can build up from there.

### Question 7: How can we make a habit harder to do?

If you want to stop a habit, make it harder:

- Add obstacles that make it less convenient.
- Remove things that remind you to do it.
- Associate it with negative feelings or consequences.

For instance, if you’re trying to use your phone less, you can turn off notifications, log out of apps, or leave your phone in another room.

### Question 8: Pick a habit you want to do more of. How can you make it easier or more attractive?

**Habit:** Drinking more water.  
**Steps:**

- Keep a water bottle on your desk so you can see it all the time.
- Use a fun or colorful bottle to make it more appealing.
- Start small by taking a few sips during breaks.
- Celebrate when you finish a bottle by smiling or feeling proud.

### Question 9: Pick a habit you want to do less of. How can you make it harder or less appealing?

**Habit:** Spending too much time on social media.  
**Steps:**

- Log out of your social media apps and turn off notifications.
- Make your phone less appealing, like setting it to gray-scale mode.
- Delete social media apps temporarily or set daily limits.
- Remind yourself of all the time you’re wasting and think about the things you could do instead.
